# AnotherCbook
AnotherCbook is a simple contact book that uses the CLI to interact with the user.

This is my first project as a programmer, it has some problems and might be simple, but i'm very proud of it. 

AnotherCbook consist of a contact book that uses a JSON archive to save the contact information. At the moment it just saves the name and the phone number of the contact

AnotherCbook doesn't have a GUI, it uses the command line interface.

At the moment the problems that need to be addresed are:
- Contacts saved in lowercase can't be searched with the same name with an uppercase.
- It will be nice if the methods of the controller were called with a number instead of the if structures that i used
